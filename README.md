# Blockchain-Based Restaurant Supply Chain

A decentralized platform that transforms restaurant supply chains through transparent supplier verification, farm-to-table ingredient tracking, food safety certification, and automated inventory management.

## Overview

This project implements a blockchain solution for the restaurant industry that creates a trusted ecosystem connecting food producers, distributors, and restaurants. It ensures food authenticity, enables complete traceability of ingredients, verifies safety compliance, and optimizes inventory management while providing transparency to all stakeholders including consumers.

## Key Components

### Supplier Verification Contract
- Validates legitimate food producers through credential verification
- Maintains a registry of approved suppliers with sustainability and quality ratings
- Stores certification documents, licenses, and inspection records
- Simplifies supplier onboarding and periodic re-verification

### Ingredient Tracking Contract
- Monitors products from farm to restaurant with complete chain of custody
- Creates unique digital identifiers for ingredient batches
- Records harvesting, processing, and transportation data
- Enables instant traceability for food safety recalls and quality issues

### Quality Certification Contract
- Records food safety compliance and testing results
- Stores temperature logs, handling procedures, and expiration data
- Verifies adherence to regulatory requirements (HACCP, FSMA, etc.)
- Facilitates health inspection reporting and compliance documentation

### Inventory Management Contract
- Tracks stock levels and ingredient usage in real-time
- Automates inventory updates upon delivery confirmation
- Creates transparent records of waste and shrinkage
- Enables smart ordering based on usage patterns and forecasts
